# nvim-lsp-file-operations

`nvim-lsp-file-operations` is a Neovim plugin that adds support for file operations using built-in [LSP
support](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).
This plugin works by subscribing to events emitted by [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua)
and [neo-tree](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim). But other integrations are possible.


## Features
* [workspace/WillRename](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_willRenameFiles)

WillRename requests supported in couple lsp-servers and allows to automagically apply some refactorings while you moving files around. Currently tested with [metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/), [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) and [typescript-language-server](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server)

**If you have usecases for any other operations please open an issue.**

## Installation
Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

### For Nvim-tree Users
```lua
use {
  'antosha417/nvim-lsp-file-operations',
  requires = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua",
  }
}
```

### For Neo-tree Users
```lua
use {
  'antosha417/nvim-lsp-file-operations',
  requires = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim",
  }
}
```

Please note that the order that the plugins load in is important, neo-tree must load before
nvim-lsp-file-operations for it to work, so nvim-lsp-file-operations depends on neo-tree and not the other way
around.

## Setup
```lua
require("lsp-file-operations").setup()
```
This is equivalent to:
```lua
require("lsp-file-operations").setup {
  -- used to see debug logs in file `vim.fn.stdpath("cache") .. lsp-file-operations.log`
  debug = false
  -- used to instruct the lsp to update all the files contained in a moved or renamed directory.
  recursive_rename = false
}
```
